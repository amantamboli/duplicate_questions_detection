# DUPLICATE QUESTION PREDICTION IN QUORA DATASET
A NLP project to find weather given 2 questions are same are not semantically speaking.

Quora is the most popular question-answer platform where users can create and edit answers and also comment on questions and its answers. The negative side of a question-answer platform is that Quora has to deal with repeated questions and answers which is a difficult task. To determine duplicate or similar questions, natural language processing is the most effective method. The cost of miss classification of duplicate questions is very high. Identifying semantically identical questions on, Question and Answering(Q&A) social media platforms like Quora is exceptionally significant to ensure that the quality and the quantity of content are presented to users, based on the intent of the question and thus enriching overall user experience. Detecting Duplicate questions is a challenging problem because natural language is very expressive, and a unique intent can be conveyed using different words, phrases, and sentence structuring.

In this project, taking Quora for our case study, we explored and applied different machine learning techniques on the task of identifying duplicate questions on Quoraâ€™s question pair dataset. Machine learning models are trained with features that can help solve this problem. That is why Quora decided to publish the challenge of classifying duplicate and non-duplicate questions using natural language processing and machine learning on Kaggle website where they can get many good solutions for their problem. The task is a binary classification problem where we need to classify duplicate and non-duplicate questions. To solve this problem various machine learning models are trained with features that can help solve this problem.
